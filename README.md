# React Project: Netflix Clone

URL: [https://yana-netflix-clone.netlify.app]

React (custom hooks, context, portals), Firebase (Firestore/auth), Compound & Styled components. This React project has multiple pages: Home, Browse (which uses Firebase authentication), sign in, and sign up. 

 ## Firebase for Sign in / Sign up 
 
 The sign in will connect to Firebase when a user tries to sign in, and when a user signs up, Firebase auth will store the user in the Firebase auth database. 
 
 ## Styled Components for all the styling  
 I built this app using React and uses Styled Components for all the styling.
 
 ## Fuse.js for live search
